        <h2>Update Plan</h2>
        <p>The plan to update the site is to improve the experience before the game starts, and the game control area. To improve the game intro area, I will remove the choose player button, and incorporate them into start the game process. User will enter the game right after they chose the number of players. Also there will be a default of 2 players if user don't chose the number of players. To enhance the game control area, I will remove the pass button and hide the fill button. Only after user spin the numbers, FILL button will appear. This way, user will have a better idea of the connection between Spin and Fill button.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Took user 30s to read the Test Menu, Test menu was too long and complicated</li>
                            <li>Around 20s on game rules, and later behavior shows user didn't remember or understand the rules well.</li>
                            <li>User skipped players' icon, chose done directly</li>
                            <li>user was confused on all the buttons, and didn't figure out each button's feature until the end of the test.</li>
                            <li>The test was not complete</li>
                            <li>It seems like user was trying to revisit the game rules after the game started, but there is no option of it.</li>
                            <li>It seems like the buttons are overloaded for user</li>

                            <li>The Task is too complicated, took a while to read (fixed before the second test, so the user test can be smoother)</li>
                            <li>Game rules are bit confusing.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>User is color blind, so the colored error message is not working for user, the other method of error message might works better. or add another way.</li>
                            <li>Game rules should be able to access inside the game. (fixed before the second test) It appears all the tester later tried to use it.</li>
                            <li>The Pass button doesn't make sense, maybe remove it or change it.</li>
