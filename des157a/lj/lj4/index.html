                    <p>I’m most excited about this drone image of the MU terminal. It’s interesting because all the buses have just come back. There are not many students at the terminal waiting for or getting off the bus, which contains essential information. This image was taken around 5 mins past any hour. It is the main picture of my collection, and it connects all the other pictures through the roof of the buses. Although the photo collection doesn’t have me in any of the photos, there are a lot of stories of me driving the buses, how I am hanging out at the terminal after I finish my driving shifts. Each line to me is different, and there are different stories; some of them are fun, some of them are quite eventful.</p>

                    <p>This photo is about Gennifer and her best friend. The interesting detail is that Gennifer and her friend are actually matching their outfit. They wear similar colors, textiles, and accessories. For example, they both wear belts with a ring-shaped golden buckle, and they both wear short jeans. It’s a fun way to match with a friend without being exactly the same. The most mysterious thing is where the photos were taken, and who is the one to take the photos. </p>
