            <p>Those visual thinking skills   introduced a brand new way of reviewing photos. I was surprised how many detailed story you can find from a single new photo. The open-ended questions are the fastest way to improved our views of an image. Zooming in, knowing more about the background or other cultures makes a huge difference of what information you are getting, such as the photo took by Mohammed Salem/Reuters. My first glance of this image is that this guys was doing a flip in an abandoned place. Looking closer, I found out there are fires, and all the buildings are clapped, so this might be a war zone. Then the meaning behind the flip is suddenly different from my point of view. Is the pain facial expression mainly because how hard is the flip? or is it because he was struggling, and sad about what just happened of his home?</p>
